<H1>Module_12_Challenge</H1>
<li>This repo contains the code for my FinTech Module 12 challenge.</li>
<H2>Application</H2>
<li>Credit risk poses a classification problem that is inherently imbalanced. This is because health loans easily outnumber risky or high risk loans. We will use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. We will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can help to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.</li>
<H3>Libraries and Technologies</H3>
<li>In this challenge code we will use JupyterLab and a few other python libraries. These libraries are:</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>scikit-learn and within scikit-learn, scikit metrics, balanced_accuracy_score and confustion_matrix.</li>
