<H1> Module 12 Credit Risk Analysis Report</H1>
<H2> Analysis Overview</H2>
<li>Credit risk poses a problem that is inherently imbalanced. This can be attributed to the number of healthy loans being outnumbered by the number of risky loans. In this analysis, we will train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. We will then use a dataset of historical lending activity to build a model that can help to identify the creditworthiness of the borrowres.</li>
<li>We used a variety of data to predict the credit risk of the borrowers. This data contained the amount of the loan, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts the borrower currently has, any derogatory marks on the borrowers credit, the total debt of the borrower and the status of the loan. We sued this data, and before creating our model we dropped the loan status column. By dropping the loan status column, the machine learning model can examine the rest of the data to predict the status of the loans for our models.</li>
<li>Using the value_counts function, we had the machine calcuate the number of 0's and 1's. In this scenario, the 0 is a healthy loan and the 1 is a high risk loans. Using the original data, this showed that there are 75036 healthy loans and 2500 high risk loans. We think used the RandomOverSampler from the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data. This gives us an equal number of 0's and 1's.</li>
<li>To begin the machine learning process we first split the data into training and testing sets. We created a "y" variable from the loan status column of the csv file and then created an x variable using the data from the remaining columns. After spliting the data, we ran s Logistic Regression Model with the original data from the csv file. We fit the regression model using the training data from the variables X_train and y_train derived from our X and y variables mentioned prior. We created a confusion matrix to show that the machine learning was operating correctly and the True Negatives and True positives had the highest values (top left and bottom right of the the confusion matrix). Next we resampled the data using the RandomOversampler from the imbalanced learn library. We basically repeated the sames steps in the machine learning process to define variables and split the data into test and train data for each variable.</li>
<H3>Results</H3>
<li>Machine Learning Model 1</li>
  <li> From Machine learning model 1, we used original data from the lending_data.csv file. We calculated what is called a balanced accuracy score. This provides us with a percentage of accuracy from the model. Using the original data in model 1, the accuracy percentage was 95.20% which is a fairly high percentage of accuracy. IN this model, the recall was also highly acurate coming in at 99% for the healthy loans and 91% for the high risk loans.</li>
<li>Machine Learning Model 2</li>
  <li>For Machine Learning Model 2, we used the random oversampler from the imbalanced-learn library. This method gave us an equal number of data points to examine. The balanced accuracy score for learning model 2 is 99.37% which is 4.17% higher than that in learning model 1. The precision and recall percentages also increased using the randome oversample in learning model 2.</li>
<H4>Summary</H4>
<li>The model that seems to perform the best is learning model 2. The level of accuracy and the confusion matrix provide data and evidence that using this model produces results with a higher percentage of accuracy.</li>
<li>Based on the statement above, I would recommend using the Machine Learning Model 2 or the RandomOverSampler model. This model provides data with a higher percentage of accuracy, it pulls a larger data set and gives more true positive and true negative results for the machien to learn and become more efficient.</li>
